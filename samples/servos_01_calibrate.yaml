# Calibration file when you're dialling in servos.
# use in conjunction with servos_01.yaml as it uses servo objects from that file.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

# 2) set the id attribute under servo.write to the servo you wish to calibrate.
# 3) Upload to your ESP
# 4) Once rebooted, navigate to the web portal (http://<device.name>.local - there will be a slider you can use to adjust the servo.
